## Voice-to-Text Desktop App

A simple and beginner-friendly voice-to-text desktop application built using Python. This app allows users to either **record their own voice** or **upload a `.wav` file**, and then converts the speech into text using **Google Speech Recognition**. It's a great mini project to learn about GUI programming, voice recognition, and Python scripting.

---

## Features

- Record your voice directly from the app
- Upload and transcribe existing `.wav` audio files
- Displays the converted text in a user-friendly window
- Built with `Tkinter`, `speech_recognition`, and `pyaudio`
- Simple design and easy to use

---

## Built With

- Python 3
- Tkinter â€“ for the graphical user interface
- SpeechRecognition â€“ to recognize speech
- PyAudio â€“ to access microphone input

---

## Install Required Libraries

Before running the app, make sure to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyaudio
```

> If you face issues installing `pyaudio`, you might need to install it using a `.whl` file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio).

---

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have all required libraries installed.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python your_filename.py
```

4. Use the GUI to either record your voice or select a `.wav` file.
5. The transcribed text will appear in the application window.
